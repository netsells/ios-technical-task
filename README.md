# iOS Technical Task

We would like you to complete a small app in Swift that lets you search for a movie using [The Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com) and display some core information about it.

This isn't a design task so don't worry too much about UI/UX - a tableview or collection view would be fine unless you have something custom you would like to implement.

Some things to consider:
* Multiple Results
* Error Handling
* Unit Tests
* Handling offline situations gracefully

We appreciate that everyone is busy and has other obligations. Not everyone can spend loads of time on a technical task. So to level the field we request that you don't spend any longer than 3 hours on this task.

Please create a private git repository (ideally github) and commit your code there as you work on it, this will show us how you use git and how quickly you did the task.

Once you are done, send a bundle* of your repo so that we may evaluate your code.
